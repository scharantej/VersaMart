## Additional Considerations

- The application should use a database to store product information, user accounts, and orders.
- The application should implement authentication and authorization to protect user data.
- The application should use a templating engine to render HTML pages.
- The application should use a CSS framework to style the web pages.
- The application should be deployed to a web server to be accessible online.
